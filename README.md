## What is next?
 - Generalize the ability to increase/decrease speaking rate. 
    - Toss that into a shared function
 - Add a "listen" feature to be able to skip typing the bots name
    - Also add a "stop-listen" feature
 - Move the "meat" of the commands to a different location. It's getting hard to read
